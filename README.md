# Multiple Object Tracking using Structural-Temporal Graph Attention

The project is built based on  the idea of the paper: [DyGLIP: A Dynamic Graph Model with Link Prediction for Accurate Multi-Camera Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06856).

<b>Note</b>: The project is still in construction.

## Example

A short example on PRW dataset:

## Todo list

- [ ] Add evaluation metrics
- [ ] Re-train model on MARS dataset
- [ ] Test model on CAMPUS dataset
